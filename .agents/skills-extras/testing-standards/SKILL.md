# Testing standards

Tests document expected behavior. Write many small, fast, isolated tests instead of a few
large ones, and test behavior rather than implementation. Aim for high coverage of critical
paths; 100% is not the goal.

**Scope.** These standards describe how to test a **settled** area — one whose shape the
developer has agreed to. Where the host's `AGENTS.md` marks an area as **shaping**, its design
is still being decided, tests are optional, and logging is the evidence instead. The obligations
below are owed when that area is promoted, not while its shape is still moving. Writing tests
against a shape that is about to change spends the budget twice and pays for the wrong one.

## Behavior-driven vs red-green TDD

Feature work uses behavior-driven scenarios: user flow, not class-by-class red-green.
Write those scenarios (or read them from the host's Human Use test contract) before
implementation, and keep re-running them after.

Classic TDD (test first, then the unit) is for critical or low-level functionality —
network, parsers, compilers, this repo's own checks — and for a bug that already
escaped: write the failing behavior test before the fix.

The pyramid, isolation, and budgets below still apply either way.

## Test pyramid

- **Unit (~70%):** individual functions and classes, fully isolated.
- **Integration (~20%):** interactions between components.
- **End-to-end (~10%):** complete user workflows.

## How tests run in this repo

> **Localize on copy.** The pyramid, structure, naming, isolation, and budgets above
> travel to any project. This section does not: replace the runner, the file layout,
> and the commands with the host's own.

- Runner: the Node.js built-in test runner (`node --test`). No Jest, Vitest, or Mocha.
- Location: `tests/unit/**/*.test.js` and `tests/integration/**/*.test.js`.
- Tests are plain JavaScript and exercise the compiled output, so `npm test` builds first.

| Command                    | Runs                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `npm test`                 | Build, then all tests            |
| `npm run test:unit`        | Build, then `tests/unit/`        |
| `npm run test:integration` | Build, then `tests/integration/` |
| `npm run test:watch`       | Build, then watch mode           |

Pass extra flags through the `--` separator, or npm swallows them:

```bash
npm test -- --test-name-pattern="validates input"   # correct
npm test --test-name-pattern="validates input"      # wrong: npm eats the flag
```

## Structure: arrange, act, assert

```js
const test = require('node:test');
const assert = require('node:assert/strict');

test('calculates total with tax', () => {
  // Arrange
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 20 }];
  const taxRate = 0.1;

  // Act
  const total = calculateTotal(items, taxRate);

  // Assert
  assert.equal(total, 33);
});
```

## Naming

Describe the behavior and the scenario: `returns an error when the email is invalid`, not
`test email`. Say what should happen and under which condition.

## Coverage

Cover the happy path, the error cases, and the edge cases: empty inputs, null values,
boundary conditions, and concurrent access where it applies.

**Test boundaries, not midpoints.** A value taken from the middle of a range is the
value at which a correct implementation and a broken one are most likely to agree.
Probe just inside and just outside each edge. Even-numbered sizes are a specific
hazard wherever something gets halved: the halfway point lands exactly on an
inclusive boundary, which can hide an off-by-half error for as long as nobody tests
anywhere else.

**Assert the effective value, not the requested one.** Where a value passes through
anything that clamps, fits, truncates, or caps, the constant in the source is not
necessarily what the system used. Read the value back at runtime and assert on that.
If a test structurally cannot observe the effective value, say so in the test rather
than leaving a green assertion that implies coverage it does not have.

## Prove a guard test fails

A test written to prevent a specific regression should be shown to catch it:
reintroduce the regression, confirm the test fails and fails for the stated reason,
restore the code, and note in the test's comment that this was done. An untested
guard test is decoration.

This is the most expensive obligation in this skill, so it is the one most worth scoping: it is
owed for guard tests in settled areas, and at promotion for bugs fixed while shaping.

For the wider version of this — checks that pass while measuring nothing — read the
`verification-evidence` skill.

## Isolation

- Each test runs independently and in any order.
- No shared mutable state between tests.
- Clean up in an `afterEach` hook — real temp directories, created files, open handles.
- Use fixtures for test data and mock external dependencies.
- Use real temp directories rather than an in-memory filesystem mock.

## Time budgets

| Tier        | Budget (total) |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Unit        | < 5 s          |
| Integration | < 60 s         |
| End-to-end  | < 5 min        |

Give every test a timeout and cancel anything that exceeds it, so a hung test fails loudly
instead of stalling CI.

## Adding a test framework to a new project

When a project has no test setup yet (this applies to host projects; this repo already uses
`node --test`):

1. **Dependencies first.** Add the runner, test utilities, type definitions, and any
   environment package (such as `jsdom`) to `devDependencies` before writing tests.
2. **Configuration.** Add the runner's config file and a shared setup/helpers module.
3. **Scripts.** Add `test`, and `test:watch` and `test:coverage` where the runner supports
   them.
4. **Verify.** Install, write one trivial test, and run the suite to confirm the wiring works
   before writing real tests.

## Checklist

- [ ] New behavior has tests
- [ ] Tests are fast and isolated
- [ ] Error cases tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
