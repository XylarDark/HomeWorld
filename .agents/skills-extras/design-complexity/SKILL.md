description: Use when designing or changing a module, public API, class split, or error policy inside a boundary that is already chosen - keep the interface small and the next change obvious; do not add shallow wrappers.

# Design complexity

**Subset of A–E:** prefer [architecture-trade-offs-design-depth](../architecture-trade-offs-design-depth/SKILL.md) when Layers C–E matter. Do not load this lean skill together with full A–E.

Working code is not the goal. A design that stays obvious under change is the goal.

**Brief:** [design-complexity-brief.md](../../../docs/architecture/design-complexity-brief.md)  
**HomeWorld defaults:** [HOMEWORLD_DESIGN.md](../../../docs/architecture/HOMEWORLD_DESIGN.md)  
**Quanta (run first):** [HOMEWORLD_TRADEOFFS.md](../../../docs/architecture/HOMEWORLD_TRADEOFFS.md)

> **Localize on copy.** Do not ban Unreal `UCLASS` inheritance. Do not invent an error taxonomy or a comment rewrite.

## When to load

A non-trivial module, API, class split, or error policy inside the game quantum (C++, Blueprint content, Python automation).

Do not load to choose a service boundary, and do not load for a typo.

## Procedure

1. Name the knowledge this module hides.
2. Name the symptom (change amplification, cognitive load, unknown unknowns) and the cause (dependency or obscurity).
3. Depth test: common case is one obvious call with defaults. List what the caller must still know.
4. Leakage test: which gameplay invariants appear in both C++ and Blueprint, or in two scripts?
5. Together or apart: merge when they share knowledge; split only when the knowledge is unrelated.
6. “Already exists” on an idempotent script is success. Do not swallow a missing asset or lost state.
7. State two designs. Pick the one with the smaller interface and the cheaper future change.
8. Draft the interface comment before the body. If it is long or full of exceptions, redesign.
9. Name the small investment now, and the check that stops a tactical pile-on later.

## Refuse

- “Just make it work” with the accepted complexity left unnamed.
- A Blueprint graph or pass-through script that repeats a C++ rule.
- Comments that repeat the code.
- A new exception that exists only because the API was drawn too tightly.
- TDD, SRP slogans, or pattern names as a substitute for a depth argument.
- A second local style in a file that already has one.
