# Session Log

Agent session summaries for cross-session context persistence.

**Agents: Read this file at the start of every task** to load prior context (completed work, blockers, errors, key decisions). Append a new entry at the end of each session. See `.cursor/rules/07-ai-agent-behavior.mdc` (Session Continuity).

## 2026-02-22 — PIE verification, character consolidation, cleanup rules

**Tasks completed:**
- Fixed GameMode DefaultPawnClass (BP_Character -> BP_HomeWorldCharacter)
- PIE verification: character spawns, on ground (MOVE_WALKING), AnimBP active, 1161 PCG actors
- Deleted stale BP_Character asset
- Cleaned up 11 one-off diagnostic scripts and 10 temp JSON files
- Added session cleanup rules to Cursor rules (07-ai-agent-behavior.mdc, 09-mcp-workflow.mdc)
- Updated all task docs with PIE verification results
- Committed and pushed all changes

**Tasks remaining:**
- Task 1 (Animation): Rebuild C++, populate AnimBP AnimGraph state machine (manual)
- Task 2 (Orientation): Manual WASD test needed
- Visual spot-check of PCG forest

**Key decisions:**
- Single character chain: AHomeWorldCharacter (C++) -> BP_HomeWorldCharacter (BP) -> ABP_HomeWorldCharacter (AnimBP)
- Temp files go in Saved/ not project root; one-off scripts deleted after use

**Errors encountered:**
- UE 5.7 API: get_pie_worlds() requires include_dedicated_server arg
- UE 5.7 API: PlayerController uses get_controlled_pawn() not get_pawn()
- GameMode DefaultPawnClass was pointing to wrong Blueprint

## 2026-02-22 — Agentic workflow improvements

**Tasks completed:**
- Created MCP harness (mcp_harness.py) for structured command-response
- Created PIE test runner (pie_test_runner.py) with reusable checks
- Enabled PythonAutomationTest plugin, created test suite (4 test files)
- Created Blueprint inspector (blueprint_inspector.py)
- Created viewport screenshot capture (capture_viewport.py)
- Expanded CI pipeline (validate.yml) with JSON, docs, C++, hygiene checks
- Documented build automation and agent utility scripts in MCP workflow rule
- Created session log mechanism (this file)
- Cleaned up stale debug references

**Key decisions:**
- Saved/ directory is the standard location for agent I/O files (not project root)
- PythonAutomationTest plugin for test_*.py auto-discovery
- MCP harness eliminates need for one-off diagnostic scripts

## 2026-02-22 — DevEnvTemplate backport, workflow audit

**Tasks completed:**
- Backported Cursor rules improvements to DevEnvTemplate (idempotency, session cleanup, error prevention)
- Committed and pushed DevEnvTemplate; updated HomeWorld submodule
- Audited project against new rule set

**Key decisions:**
- DevEnvTemplate receives general improvements; Unreal/MCP-specific rules stay in HomeWorld

## 2026-02-22 — Task audit and doc cleanup

**Tasks completed:**
- Audited all task docs; removed verbose "what's done" sections
- TASKLIST and task docs now focus only on remaining work to finish/verify
- Task 3 (ground) and Task 4 (PCG) marked verified; optional follow-ups only
- Task 1 (animation): Rebuild C++, manual AnimGraph, PIE test
- Task 2 (orientation): PIE WASD test, optional MeshForwardYawOffset

**Note:** PIE tests via MCP require Editor to be running and connected.

**Latest (Editor open):** Ran `pie_test_runner.py` via MCP. Results: 5/7 passed — PIE active, character spawned, on ground, capsule 88/42, PCG 1161 actors. Skeletal mesh and AnimInstance checks returned false negatives (Python/PIE reflection).

## 2026-02-22 — Bare-bones stack foundations

**Tasks completed:**
- Added AHomeWorldPlayerState (C++); GameMode sets PlayerStateClass.
- GAS replication for simulated proxies: PossessedBy inits ASC with Owner = PlayerState when !IsLocallyControlled() && !HasAuthority().
- Created docs/CONTENT_LAYOUT.md (content paths contract); referenced from SETUP and STACK_PLAN.
- World Partition: SETUP step 5 and validation bullet (Main map WP enabled); STACK_PLAN Layer 1 lock (engine 5.7, PC/Steam EA); DaySequence and SteamSockets tech choices in Layers 6–7; AGENTS.md lock line.
- Added UBuildPlacementSupport (Blueprint Function Library) with GetPlacementHit(WorldContextObject, MaxDistance, OutHit) for build/placement trace contract.

**Note:** C++ build was not run (Live Coding active). Rebuild after closing Editor to compile new files.

## 2026-02-24 — Resume after rebuild

**Context:** Previous chat crashed; user was asked to rebuild and did so.

**Rebuild:** Build-HomeWorld.bat run successfully (Result: Succeeded, 9.86s). HomeWorldPlayerState, BuildPlacementSupport, HomeWorldGameMode, HomeWorldCharacter compiled and linked.

**Next:** Task 1 — With Editor open, run `setup_animation_blueprint.py` via MCP; then manual AnimGraph (Locomotion state machine, Idle/Walk on Speed); PIE test. Task 2 — PIE WASD orientation check.

---

## 2026-02-24 — Bare-bones stack completion (all weeks, core tech only)

**Tasks completed:** Week 1: GAS DefaultAbilities granting, GetPlacementTransform, animation doc. Week 2: GAS needs doc, AHomeWorldAIController, UHomeWorldSessionSubsystem stub, UHomeWorldTimeOfDaySubsystem stub. Weeks 3–4: UHomeWorldLeaderboardSubsystem stub, TimeOfDay implementation doc, Mass/swarms doc in STACK_PLAN and KNOWN_ERRORS. Docs: STACK_PLAN Implementation status table, SESSION_LOG entry.

**Key decisions:** Only stable foundations (contracts, base classes, stubs); no content. Subsystems are stubs; backends in Week 2+.

**Errors encountered:** Build failed with Live Coding active; close Editor and run Build-HomeWorld.bat to compile.
