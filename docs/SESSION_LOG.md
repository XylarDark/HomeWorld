# Session Log

Agent session summaries for cross-session context persistence.

**Agents: Read this file at the start of every task** to load prior context (completed work, blockers, errors, key decisions). Append a new entry at the end of each session. See `.cursor/rules/07-ai-agent-behavior.mdc` (Session Continuity).

## 2026-02-22 — PIE verification, character consolidation, cleanup rules

**Tasks completed:**
- Fixed GameMode DefaultPawnClass (BP_Character -> BP_HomeWorldCharacter)
- PIE verification: character spawns, on ground (MOVE_WALKING), AnimBP active, 1161 PCG actors
- Deleted stale BP_Character asset
- Cleaned up 11 one-off diagnostic scripts and 10 temp JSON files
- Added session cleanup rules to Cursor rules (07-ai-agent-behavior.mdc, 09-mcp-workflow.mdc)
- Updated all task docs with PIE verification results
- Committed and pushed all changes

**Tasks remaining:**
- Task 1 (Animation): Rebuild C++, populate AnimBP AnimGraph state machine (manual)
- Task 2 (Orientation): Manual WASD test needed
- Visual spot-check of PCG forest

**Key decisions:**
- Single character chain: AHomeWorldCharacter (C++) -> BP_HomeWorldCharacter (BP) -> ABP_HomeWorldCharacter (AnimBP)
- Temp files go in Saved/ not project root; one-off scripts deleted after use

**Errors encountered:**
- UE 5.7 API: get_pie_worlds() requires include_dedicated_server arg
- UE 5.7 API: PlayerController uses get_controlled_pawn() not get_pawn()
- GameMode DefaultPawnClass was pointing to wrong Blueprint

## 2026-02-22 — Agentic workflow improvements

**Tasks completed:**
- Created MCP harness (mcp_harness.py) for structured command-response
- Created PIE test runner (pie_test_runner.py) with reusable checks
- Enabled PythonAutomationTest plugin, created test suite (4 test files)
- Created Blueprint inspector (blueprint_inspector.py)
- Created viewport screenshot capture (capture_viewport.py)
- Expanded CI pipeline (validate.yml) with JSON, docs, C++, hygiene checks
- Documented build automation and agent utility scripts in MCP workflow rule
- Created session log mechanism (this file)
- Cleaned up stale debug references

**Key decisions:**
- Saved/ directory is the standard location for agent I/O files (not project root)
- PythonAutomationTest plugin for test_*.py auto-discovery
- MCP harness eliminates need for one-off diagnostic scripts
